# godot-capa

A Capability-based Gameplay System plugin for Godot. Provides capability-based debugging and auxiliary tools.

## What is a Capability?

Capabilities are a gameplay code organization pattern used by Hazelight Studios during the development of Split Fiction.
Capabilities can be seen as a distant cousin to Systems in ECS, as both are responsible for behavior, but Capabilities are used within a GameObject-Component structure.
